- Real-time Database with Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore:

Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore can provide real-time data synchronization across clients. You can integrate this feature to enable live updates for various parts of your website, such as chat applications, live notifications, or collaborative editing.

- Authentication with Firebase Authentication:

Implement Firebase Authentication to allow users to sign up, sign in, and manage their accounts securely. This service supports various authentication methods like email/password, Google, Facebook, etc. You can easily integrate it with your Express.js backend to authenticate users before accessing certain parts of your website or performing actions like posting comments or accessing personalized content.

- File Storage with Firebase Storage:

Use Firebase Storage to store user-generated content such as images, videos, or files. This facility can be handy for implementing features like profile picture uploads, file attachments, or media sharing. You can utilize Firebase SDK to upload, download, and manage files directly from your React components or Express.js backend.

- Real-time Notifications with Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM):

Integrate Firebase Cloud Messaging to send real-time notifications to your users across different platforms (web, mobile, etc.). You can use FCM to notify users about new messages, updates, or any relevant activity on your website. Combine this with Firebase Authentication to send personalized notifications based on user preferences or actions.

- Data Storage and Querying with MongoDB:

Utilize MongoDB as your primary database for storing and querying structured data. MongoDB's flexibility and scalability make it suitable for various types of applications. You can store user profiles, posts, comments, and other application data in MongoDB. Express.js can handle CRUD operations on MongoDB documents efficiently, and React can display the data dynamically on your website's frontend.
